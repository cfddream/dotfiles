# look in /etc/defaults/etc/skel/.inputrc

# Modifying /etc/skel/.inputrc directly will prevent

# The copy in your home directory (~/.inputrc) is yours, please
# feel free to customise it to create a shell
# environment to your liking.  If you feel a change
# would be benifitial to all, please feel free to send
# a patch to the cygwin mailing list.
